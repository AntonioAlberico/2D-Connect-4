To run this code, just open up the "3D connect 4" folder in some program that can run C++ and combile/build using CMake. Then, just click the run button with the "main.cpp" file open. That's it. Nothing special. 

This is connect four, so standard connect four rules apply. Once the program is running, the command window will prompt you to type in a number 1-7. These represent the columns you can put your pieces in. Gravity  is real. 

This is a two player game (real-humans), and no AI for it exists.
